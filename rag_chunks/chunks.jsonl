Assistant referees\nBeep signal\nThe beep signal system is an additional signal which is only used to gain the\nreferee’s attention.

In all other situations,\nthe AR must wait and offer an opinion if it is required and then inform the\nreferee of what was seen and heard, and which players were involved.\nBefore signalling for an offence, the AR must determine that:\n•  the offence was out of the referee’s view or the referee’s view was obstructed\n•  the referee would not have applied the advantage\nWhen an offence occurs which requires a signal from the AR, the AR must:\n•  raise the flag with the same hand that will also be used for the remainder of\nthe signal – this gives the referee a clear indication as to who will be awarded\nthe free kick\n• make eye contact with the referee\n•  give the flag a slight wave back and forth (avoiding any excessive or\naggressive movement)\nThe AR must use the ‘wait and see technique’ to allow play to continue and not\nraise the flag when the team against which an offence has been committed will\nbenefit from the advantage; it is therefore very important for the AR to make\neye contact with the referee.\nFouls inside the penalty area\nWhen a foul is committed by a defender inside the penalty area out of the\nvision of the referee, especially if near to the AR’s position, the AR must first\nmake eye contact with the referee to see where the referee is positioned and\nwhat action has been taken. If the referee has not taken any action, the AR must\nsignal with the flag, use the electronic beep signal and then visibly move down\nthe touchline towards the corner flag.\nFlag technique\nThe AR’s flag must always be unfurled and visible to the referee. This usually\nmeans the flag is carried in the hand closest to the referee. When making a\nsignal, the AR stops running, faces the field of play, makes eye contact with the\nreferee and raises the flag with a deliberate (not hasty or exaggerated) motion.\nThe flag should be like an extension of the arm. The ARs must raise the flag\nusing the hand that will be used for the next signal. If circumstances change\nand the other hand must be used, the AR should move the flag to the opposite\nhand below the waist. If the AR signals that the ball is out of play, the signal\nmust be maintained until the referee acknowledges it.\nIf the AR signals for a sending-off offence and the signal is not seen\nimmediately:\n•  if play has been stopped, the restart may be changed in accordance with the\nLaws (free kick, penalty kick, etc.)\n•  if play has restarted, the referee may still take disciplinary action but not\npenalise the offence with a free kick or penalty kick\nGestures\nAs a general rule, the AR should not use obvious hand signals. However, in\nsome instances, a discreet hand signal may assist the referee. The hand signal\nshould have a clear meaning which should have been agreed in the pre-match\ndiscussion.\nSignals\nSee Law 6 for diagrams of signals\nCorner kick/goal kick\nWhen the ball wholly passes over the goal line, the AR raises the flag with the\nright hand (better line of vision) to inform the referee that the ball is out of\nplay and then if it is:\n•  near to the AR – indicate whether it is a goal kick or a corner kick\n• far from the AR – make eye contact and follow the referee’s decision\nWhen the ball clearly passes over the goal line, the AR does not need to raise\nthe flag to indicate that the ball has left the field of play. If the goal kick or\nLaws of the Game 2025/26 | Practical guidelines for match officials\n\nFouls outside the penalty area\nWhen a foul is committed by a defender outside the penalty area (near the\nboundary of the penalty area), the AR should make eye contact with the\nreferee, to see the referee’s position and what action has been taken, and signal\nwith the flag if necessary. In counter-attack situations, the AR should be able\nto give information such as whether or not a foul has been committed and\nwhether a foul was committed inside or outside the penalty area, and what\ndisciplinary action should be taken. The AR should make a clear movement\nalong the touchline towards the halfway line to indicate when the offence took\nplace outside the penalty area.\nGoal – no goal\nWhen it is clear that the ball has wholly passed over the goal line in the goal,\nthe AR must make eye contact with the referee without giving any additional\nsignal.\nWhen a goal has been scored but it is not clear whether the ball has passed\nover the line, the AR must first raise the flag to attract the referee’s attention\nand then confirm the goal.\nOffside\nThe first action of the AR for an offside decision is to raise the flag (using the\nright hand, giving the AR a better line of vision) and then, if the referee stops\nplay, use the flag to indicate the area of the field of play in which the offence\noccurred. If the flag is not immediately seen by the referee, the AR must\nmaintain the signal until it has been acknowledged or the ball is clearly in the\ncontrol of the defending team.\nPenalty kick\nIf the goalkeeper blatantly moves off the goal line before the ball is kicked and\nprevents a goal from being scored, the AR should indicate the encroachment\naccording to the pre-match instructions from the referee.\nSubstitution\nOnce the AR has been informed (by the fourth official or team official) that a\nsubstitution is requested, the AR must signal this to the referee at the next\nstoppage.\nThrow-in\nWhen the ball wholly passes over the touchline:\n•  near to the AR – a direct signal should be made to indicate the direction of\nthe throw-in\n•  far from the AR and the throw-in decision is an obvious one – the AR must\nmake a direct signal to indicate the direction of the throw-in\n•  far from the AR and the AR is in doubt about the direction of the throw-in\n– the AR must raise the flag to inform the referee that the ball is out of play,\nmake eye contact with the referee and follow the referee’s signal", "chunk_id": "law17_c0112", "source_file": "Law_17__The Corner Kick.json"}
